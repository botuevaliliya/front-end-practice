# Online Shop â€“ Vanilla JS Practice Project

A simple e-commerce frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a working shopping cart, item quantity management, and live price updates.

## What I Practiced

- DOM manipulation (event listeners, element creation, innerHTML)
- Dynamic content rendering using vanilla JS
- Cart state logic (add/remove/update)
- JavaScript functions & conditionals
- Basic UI interactions and styling

This project was built independently by following JavaScript tutorials on YouTube. Unlike my static HTML/CSS Stepik course project, this one introduced me to interactivity and browser-based logic without any frameworks or libraries.
