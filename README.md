# Front-End Development Journey

This folder documents my learning path as a front-end developer — from my very first static HTML pages to building full React applications and designing interfaces in Figma. Every project here represents a step forward: a deeper skill, a new tool, or a more dynamic feature.

### It all started with HTML & CSS (folder stepik_course)

I began with the **Stepik HTML & CSS course**, where I learned the foundations of web development: how the internet works, how to structure content with HTML, and how to style it with CSS. I deployed my first static site and experienced the magic of seeing code come to life in a browser.

### Learning Vanilla JavaScript (folder html_ecom)

Motivated to add interactivity, I followed YouTube tutorials and built small but functional projects using **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, just core browser APIs and logic. I created features like dynamic shopping carts, DOM manipulation, and custom UI behavior.

### Building with React & Figma – Meta Coursera Program (folder coursera_meta)

To take my skills to a professional level, I completed the **Meta Front-End Developer Certificate** (9-course series on Coursera), where I learned to build scalable applications using **React**, manage code in GitHub, and prototype UI using **Figma**.
I also earned the **Google UX Design Certificate**, learning how to approach user-centered design and build professional UX case studies.
